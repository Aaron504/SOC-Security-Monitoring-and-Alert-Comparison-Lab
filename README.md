In this lab, I monitored security events and incidents across multiple data sources, including SecurityEvent, Syslog, SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident, and AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL. The environment was observed for 24 hours, during which I collected and analyzed alerts and incidents. After securing the environment, I allowed another 24-hour observation period and compared the number and severity of alerts before and after implementing the security measures. This lab demonstrates my ability to monitor security events, respond to incidents, and evaluate the effectiveness of security hardening in a SOC environment.

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

Phase 1: Vulnerable Deployment
Deployed VMs with:
- Open ports: SSH (22), RDP (3389), SMB (445)
- Outdated software and missing patches
- Default or weak credentials (e.g., admin/admin123)
- Enabled NSG flow logs and packet capture

Phase 2: 24-Hour Threat Window

After deploying the vulnerable virtual machines in various global Azure regions, the environment was left completely exposed for 24 hours with no security controls in place. During this time, Microsoft Sentinel collected telemetry data using NSG flow logs and syslog messages. The findings were mapped visually using built-in geolocation queries.

 Key Observations:
- Over 1,000+ RDP and SSH brute-force attempts were detected in less than a day
- Multiple cities had more than 400 failed login attempts
- NSG misconfigurations led to 930+ confirmed malicious flows reaching target VMs
- Attack traffic originated from over 25 countries, including those commonly associated with botnet infrastructure
- All traffic was collected passively, with no bait interaction â€” confirming the high-risk profile of publicly exposed VMs

Phase 3: Hardening & Remediation
Applied:
- OS updates and patching
- Strong password policies
- Disabled unnecessary ports/services
- Configured NSGs to allow only whitelisted IPs

Phase 4: Post-Remediation Analysis

After completing all hardening steps including OS patching, disabling exposed services, enforcing password complexity, tightening NSG rules, and deploying brute-force prevention, the environment was left untouched for an additional 24 hours to monitor the impact. The results were conclusive and showed a dramatic drop in malicious activity across all metrics:

These findings validate that even basic cloud security hardening significantly reduces a VM's exposure and attractiveness to automated attacks and global threat actors. By applying foundational defense-in-depth techniques, this experiment demonstrated how a vulnerable, high-risk environment can be transformed into a low-noise, hardened asset within a single cloud platform.

This phase reinforces the value of:

- Proactive monitoring
- Geo-aware firewall policies
- Least privilege network access
- Routine patch management
