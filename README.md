In this lab, I monitored security events and incidents across multiple data sources, including SecurityEvent, Syslog, SecurityAlert, SecurityIncident, and AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL. The environment was observed for 24 hours, during which I collected and analyzed alerts and incidents. After securing the environment, I allowed another 24-hour observation period and compared the number and severity of alerts before and after implementing the security measures. This lab demonstrates my ability to monitor security events, respond to incidents, and evaluate the effectiveness of security hardening in a SOC environment.
